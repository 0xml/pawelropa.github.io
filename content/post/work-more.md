##Love work

Few days back I have read terrific post about work by [Tynan](http://tynan.com/lovework). One of comments contained a link to an article about Mr Thomas Edison, more specific an [interview](https://mises.org/daily/4986) with him. I clicked the link and started reading. To my surprise I've read Edison's answer to one of the question



>"Well," he replied, "for 15 years I have worked on an average of 20 hours a day."



Well that's almost insane. Since about a year I've done 50-60 hours work weeks, that's above average for most of the people, thus I considered myself a hard-working man, well I don't anymore.



###Success



How does one achieve success? Mr Edison, one of the most successful people ever lived, gave us some advice.



>You do something all day long, don't you? Everyone does. If you get up at seven o'clock and go to bed at eleven, you have put in sixteen good hours, and it is certain with most men, that they have been doing something all the time. They have been either walking, or reading, or writing, or thinking. **The only trouble is that they do it about a great many things and I do it about one.** If they took the time in question and applied it in one direction, to one object, they would succeed.



>"Success is sure to follow such application. The trouble lies in the fact that **people do not have an object â€” one thing to which they stick, letting all else go**. Success is the product of the severest kind of mental and physical application."



I will follow his advice, focus on one thing and one thing only, namely iOS and web development.
