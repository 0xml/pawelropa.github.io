Since last year I have been reading [the minimalists blog](http://www.theminimalists.com/). At first the idea of minimalism seemed silly to me, why would anybody willingly give up stuff, after all majority of people work so hard to get this new TV, or dress or whatever it is. The concept intrigued me.


Last month doing my daily routine, reading [hacker news](http://news.ycommbinator.com) I have encountered a blog post [startup in Thailand](http://levels.io/bootstrapping-startup-thailand/). Cool story, I liked it so much that I have read this guy whole blog. Peter (that is his name) is also a minimalist, this was the drop that spilled the cup.

I am currently bootstrapping my own company, I have released four apps to date:

* [~~Zen Blocks~~](http://bit.ly/19OHLku)
* [~~Tip % Calculator~~](http://bit.ly/195mHnm)
* [~~Gem Crush~~](http://bit.ly/1asZv3r)
* [~~Memory Fish~~](http://bit.ly/19Qlz7k)

and distractions decrease my productivity. Removing all my stuff and leaving only my MacBook Pro, iPad, and iPhone to work with should in theory make me more productive. I am really excited starting this new journey.

*I am officially a minimalist*.
