Today's short post will be about another great book namely *Slight Edge* by Jeff Olson.

If I had to sum up the whole book in one sentance it would be - every day routine matters greatly.

We all have this little day to day task, some are boring some are exciting, the problem with all is *we simply stop doing them after few days or months*. Reason? There will be no significant difference if we will not do those 10 pushups. Two months later comes this thought, *oh gosh I had this commitment, where would I be now if i had done it everyday... to late to start now...* That's how most of the people usualy end theirs commitments.

Jeff in his book writes about this kind of problems. His advices are simple but effective. I wish I had read *Slight Edge* when I was in my teens, but theres never to late to improve ones life and read [his terrific book](http://bit.ly/16zHrno)!
