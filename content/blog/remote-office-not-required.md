Today I have read for the second time terrific book [Remote by Jason Fried & David Heinemeier Hansson](http://bit.ly/17YJc1C). I feel like the book deserves a review so I will write a little summary of each chapter.



####The Time is Right For Remote Work



* **Why work doesn't happen at work.**

Yes I know what they are talking about. When I was working nine-to-five job if I wanted to be really productive I had to come early or stay late to get my job done. Socializing, office politics usually takes big chunk of working hours, there is simply no way around it.



* **Stop commuting your life away.**

Getting to the office and back to home is inefficient.



* **It's the technology, stupid.** All the technology is there to make remote work possible. The reason people still work in office is humans resist change.



* **City as talent hub.** Why not expand area where you can find talented people, why search only in your city or country?



* **You're probably already doing it.** If you are a software developer you most certainly worked for your company from your home. Some feature has to be done by tomorrow?



####Dealing With Excuses



* **Trusting your employes.** One of many excuses is if I can't see my employees, how do I know if the are working or not? It basically comes down to trust, generally people enjoy working (I certainly do). Don't you trust a programmer you are paying salary? Why hire him in the first place? If someone want to stay idle and do nothing all day, he will.

* **Loosing control.**  You don't have to see your employes to know what they are doing, again it all comes down to trust, people want to create and work.

* **Big business is already doing it.** IBM, S.C., Johnson & Son, eBay have some of theirs employees working remotely.



####How to Collaborate Remotely

Working remotely requires compromise.



* **Thou shalt overlap.** Members of your team are geographically dispersed, that means different time zones. You have to set hours in which all of your members will be available online. Four hours overlap time proposed by the authors seems reasonable.

* **Sharing a screen.** Sometimes is easier to describe something by showing it, but your colleague is one thousand mils away, how do you do this? Use a shared screen software like *WebEx*, *GoToMeeting* or any other similar tool.

* **Keep everything accessible to everyone** Share your calendar, what to do next, files or anything you are working on online.

* **Forward motion.** *Everyone chimes in with a few lines about what they've done over the past week and what's intended for the next week.* It's very simple solution to keep everybody informed about the current status of projects and company.

* **The work is what matters.** You evaluate only what your employee has done. Any other criteria are unnecessary



####Beware the Dragons

* **Isolation is bad for you** Occasional meetings face to face are good for the team.

* **To much work.** Usually remote workers will get too much stuff done, that's because it is easy to stretch ones workday from 7am to 9pm, which repeated will eventually leed to burnout. Establish reasonable expectations.

* **Ergonomic basics.** Get proper desk, proper chair, and proper screen.

* **Clients.** Inform your clients early you will not meet face-to-face. Provide references before client even asks.



####Hiring and Keeping the Best

* **It's a big world.** Think internationally when it comes to recruitment, it will dramatically increase your talent pool.

* **Don't keep poisonous people.** Monitor your work atmosphere, one bad apple spoils bunch.

* **Great workers.** It's much harder to fake your way as remote worker. Everything is being tracked, it has to be. Quiet but productive workers can shine.

* **Writing.** Being a good writer is very important. People communicate usually by mail or IM, thus expressing one thoughts clearly is very important.

* **Meeting them in person.** its very important.



####Managing Remote Workers

* ** Meetings** Get together from time to time. Meetings are great way to introduce new people to the team.

* **Learn from open source.** Some of open source projects are very complex. Majority of work is being done by remote collaboration and communication. You should look more closely at how exactly it's being done.

* **One-on-ones.** Do casual meetings from time to time. It will help you monitor morale and motivation of your team.

* **Scarcity.** If meetings are scarce we tend to value them more. They also seem more interesting.



####Life As A Remote Worker



* **Routine.** Differentiate work and play time. Develop routine, it will help your mind to recognize the difference between work and other activities. Otherwise it's probable everything will start to mix together and you won't be able to tell when you actually worked.

* **Coffee shops.** Solitude is bad for you, change your environment from time to time, go to coffee shop or library and work from there.

* **Nomadic freedom.** You can work from anywhere in the world, why wait till retirement, you can start traveling now!
