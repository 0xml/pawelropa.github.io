App Code


I have bought [AppCode](http://www.jetbrains.com/objc/) about 8 months ago and have been using it sence then. It has a lot of features (especially in version 2.5.x JetBrains guys added some crazy ones). Currently some of the main ones are.



* Support for CocoaPods!

* UnitTest status

* Great refactoring support!

* Lots of plugins

* Fuzzy autocompletition



Features I don't use, or wish they were.



* Git, Mercurial support - I find using console much more productive, *git st*, *git aa*, *git ci -m "Done some stuff"* bam done! No mouse clicking, no nothing!

* Debugger console won't hide after finishing debugging session. I do most of my work on *15 inch MacBook Pro* and extra pixels are really important.

* Apple is pushing really hard on using Storyboards, AppCode don't have this feature (and probably won't have it in the future).



###Xcode

Xcode 3 was pretty decent (not counting occasional crashes), in 4 Apple used more multithreading which caused sometimes unexpected behavior and occasional crashes, I didn't liked it. A month ago I figured few months have passed since Apple released Xcode 5, and few bug fixes it's time to give it a try (use it more than one day).



First what annoys me.



* Sometimes when I run Unit Tests, I get notification center message "Test Failed" despite that all tests have passed.



* Xcode lacks proper refactoring features if compared with AppCode. I didn't notice it before but after using AppCode for longer period of time I miss it badly.



The list would be much longer if not for great plugins which are currently available for Xcode! Below list of plugins which I find most useful.



* [Alcatraz](https://github.com/mneorr/Alcatraz) plugin manager

* [FuzzyAutocomplete](https://github.com/chendo/FuzzyAutocompletePlugin) name speaks for itself

* [XVim](https://github.com/JugglerShu/XVim) great Vim plugin with customization options



I also use many code snippets, they also boost my productivity.
