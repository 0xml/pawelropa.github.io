            <p>Good habits are essential to every productive person, I have been working on them very hard for over a year now. During this time I have read a few books on this topic, recently The Willpower Instinct by Kelly McGonigal Ph.D. Today I would like to talk about Tynan&rsquo;s new book namely Superhuman by Habit.
The book is segmented into two main parts - building habits and choosing them. It&rsquo;s quite condensed, a good reader could finish entire book in one go, which I really like and it does not contain all the unnecessary fillers which are pretty common in other publications. <a class="read-more" href="/post/superhuman-by-habit/">&raquo;</a></p>

            <p>What is markdown It&rsquo;s a plain text formating syntax, which is easy to read, optionally it can be converted to HTML.
Why use it Because it is really easy, fast and powerfull. Without markdown one can use basically text editor and mouse to format text, the other option is to write text in pure HTML to format it nicely, but it&rsquo;s much harder (nobody really want to type those ugly tags). <a class="read-more" href="/post/markdown-and-ghost/">&raquo;</a></p>

I have bought AppCode about 8 months ago and have been using it sence then. It has a lot of features (especially in version 2.5.x JetBrains guys added some crazy ones). Currently some of the main ones are.
 Support for CocoaPods!
 UnitTest status
 Great refactoring support!
 Lots of plugins
 Fuzzy autocompletition
  Features I don&rsquo;t use, or wish they were.
 Git, Mercurial support - I find using console much more productive, git st, git aa, git ci -m &ldquo;Done some stuff&rdquo; bam done! <a class="read-more" href="/post/appcode-vs-xcode/">&raquo;</a></p>

Some books have the power to change your life for better. Those are hard to find, especially because every one of us has different criteria of what better is.
