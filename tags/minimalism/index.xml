      <description>Since last year I have been reading the minimalists blog. At first the idea of minimalism seemed silly to me, why would anybody willingly give up stuff, after all majority of people work so hard to get this new TV, or dress or whatever it is. The concept intrigued me. Last month doing my daily routine, reading hacker news I have encountered a blog post startup in Thailand. Cool story, I liked it so much that I have read this guy whole blog.</description>
