      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s short post will be about another great book namely Slight Edge by Jeff Olson.
If I had to sum up the whole book in one sentance it would be - every day routine matters greatly.
We all have this little day to day task, some are boring some are exciting, the problem with all is we simply stop doing them after few days or months. Reason? There will be no significant difference if we will not do those 10 pushups.</description>
