      <description>Good habits are essential to every productive person, I have been working on them very hard for over a year now. During this time I have read a few books on this topic, recently The Willpower Instinct by Kelly McGonigal Ph.D. Today I would like to talk about Tynan&amp;rsquo;s new book namely Superhuman by Habit.
The book is segmented into two main parts - building habits and choosing them. It&amp;rsquo;s quite condensed, a good reader could finish entire book in one go, which I really like and it does not contain all the unnecessary fillers which are pretty common in other publications.</description>
